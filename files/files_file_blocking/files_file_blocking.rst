#. Open a PowerShell window by clicking on the **PowerShell icon** on the taskbar. Enter the following command where you will see an access denied error message:

   .. code-block:: bash

	 new-item \\xyz-files.ntnxlab.local\marketing\MyMovie.flv

#. Select **Next** then **Save** on the **Summary** page to complete the update.

#. Blocked file type settings at the share level override the server level setting.  Using PowerShell issue the same command as the previous step.  The command will now complete successfully.
